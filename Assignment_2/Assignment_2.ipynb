    "# Assignment 2: Data Science Workflows in R\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will analyze city bike usage in Helsinki, Finland.  The data comes from the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority and was compiled into the [Helsinki City Bikes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geometrein/helsinki-city-bikes) dataset by Tigran Khachatryan, licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.  We are only working with _a small, sampled subset_ of the data here (the full dataset is almost 2 GB!).  Additionally, we use weather observations from the [Finnish Meteorological Institute](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/download-observations), licensed under CC BY 4.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- The assignment is structured into parts, each of which consists of one or more tasks and/or questions.  You should provide your code to arrive at the solutions _directly below_ the respective task/question in this notebook.  You can add as many cells as you want and perform as many intermediate steps as you want, but **the last output of each task/question should clearly show the answer** to that task or question.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are allowed to consult any resources (books/websites/exercises), but each assignment group should **work on the assignment on their own.**   You may ask questions about specific R/Tidyverse/ggplot2/etc. functionality or about the exercises on Canvas, but **you may _not_ directly share answers for tasks in this assignment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should **submit your finished assignment as a single Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) _or_ R Markdown (.Rmd) file** through Canvas. ***Before you submit,*** make sure that your notebook runs correctly from start to finish. In Jupyter Notebook, you can do this by going to the menu, choosing \"Kernel\", then \"Restart & Run All\", and verify that all cells show the expected output. With R Markdown, you can do this by \"Knitting\" your document to HTML or PDF, and verifying that everything looks as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "- This assignment is graded Pass/Fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order of importance, the criteria for passing are **demonstrating an understanding** of how to implement data science tasks in R, **correctness** of the solution, as well as **clean coding style**. You do _not_ need to find the \"shortest\" or \"most elegant\" solution to each problem. It is more important that you show an understanding of how to manipulate, visualize, and model data in R; arrive at a correct solution; and that I can understand your reasoning for what you did and why you did it. I encourage you to _use comments in your code_ to explain your approach when the code gets more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- To _pass_ this assignment, you must provide a solution for _all of the tasks below_.  You can still pass if some of your solutions are not entirely correct or lacking in coding style, as long as they show a general understanding of how to approach the problem.\n",
